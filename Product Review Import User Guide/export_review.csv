I didn't think anything of it but when powered on the computer had a loud whirling sound. A few hours later it refused to turn on. It appears the cheap internal fan broke. I got a new one 2 weeks later. This time the optical drive broke 3 weeks later. I was beginning to become frustrated. After calling customer service they refused to give me a full refund because it had been over 60 days since I first bought it. I hesitantly accepted a third replacement. This one works but the shift button broke already and power cord no longer fits into the computer snugly. I ended up selling it to my cousin and buying a Mac.","SupaStar","","1:1@3:12@2:6","110"

"2008-04-13 14:37:39","MA464LL/A","1","Apple has done it again!","The MacBook Pro is Apple's latest notebook and their first with Intel's new attempt at notebook dominance, the Core Duo.  It represents the near peak of current notebook technology in terms of power, making only a few compromises for the sake of a slim profile and a better battery life.  I am a college student who has been lusting over notebooks for the past two years, but with so many choices and every promising notebook seemingly always lacking in an essential area I was paralyzed by indecision (and a lack of funds).  I will be attending Law School next fall and the time has finally come when owning a notebook is no longer an option. Luckily, notebook technology is better than ever, and I finally had some notebooks to choose from that represent nearly everything I have wanted since I first got the idea in my head that I needed one. I have simple needs: gaming capable graphics card, near desktop power, low weight, bright screen, decent battery life, and sweet looks (you know, the basics).

Once I saw the Core Duo I knew the day had arrived and that any laptop I bought was going to have it.  I have to have a laptop before August so that took out waiting for the 64bit Core Duo sequel that is coming out sometime later this year or early next year (Merom).

The notebooks I considered getting were the W3J, the Acer 8204, and the new MacBook Pro from Apple, all top of the line machines which had the Radeon X1600 and the new Core Duo.  The Apple wasn't really an option because the Law School I am attending requires a Windows machine.  The Acer just had too many complaints of a poor screen and other problems, although I know people who are enjoying the machine just fine.  I actually ordered the W3J last week but was dismayed to discover that my preorder wasn't made quite soon enough and I was going to have to wait even longer if I wanted that option.  My preorder was cancelled about 4 days after the announcement of Boot Camp, which was not just a hack, but the promise of an (in the future) officially supported dual boot program.  I'm no fool, and I wasn't going to spit the notebook gods in the face.  I had been given a sign, and 24 hours later I picked up my (educationally discounted at $2,299) brand new MacBook Pro.  This is my first Apple ever, but with the safety net of Boot Camp, I figured the time to dive in was now.","Stephen Lee","","1:5@3:13@2:9","99"

Good Camera, October 11, 2006
By 	Steve (FL) - See all my reviews
Got it yesterday. In green. Actually it's a shiney yellowish-green. Nice feel. Fits well in shirt pocket. Very light; particullarly compared to my Pentax Optio 550. Good, nice size LCD. Easy to use yet with nice availability of choices for customization. Well written manual (you can find online thru google) and onboard help menu. Photos come out fairly nice. Tried indoors in low light with several scene settings, outdoors, macro, and supermacro. Colors look true, fairly sharp without noticable artifact. Used in South Florida morning daylight outside without any trouble with LCD viewing (camera has no classic viewfinder). Have read reviews of washout in bright sun: have not tried that yet. Overall, I'm happy with the camera thus far. ","Jenella","1","1:4@2:10@3:13","51"
"2007-08-28 23:29:57","A630","1","Amazing camera value!","This is one of those nice cameras that's so well done, it's easier to talk about what the camera ISN'T, rather than what it IS! This camera is not a small, shirt pocket camera, and might be a bit bigger than a woman would wish to carry in a purse. It's not a super-tele camera, but it does have a respectable, bit longer than average 4x optical zoom. ","Juan","1","1:5@2:10@3:14","50"
"2007-08-28 23:28:35","C530","1","great for everyday use","I purchased this camera a few months ago because I like to have a camera on hand always. My DSLR and 35 mm SLR cameras are too bulky for everyday. The price and MPs were right, as well as the small size which fits into the clean pockets of any of my purses- no need to worry about lens scratch. For those who don't carry a purse and are concerned about the lens, a very small case will do the trick. The images are clean although I've only printed up to 8.5 X 11 so far.","Stull","1","1:2@2:9@3:13","49"

"2007-08-28 16:40:25","Rebel XT","1"," The best thing I've ever bought","The XT is amazing. The battery comes partly charged so you can immedietly start using the camera (thank you Canon!) I've already shot about 200 pictures with it and the battery hasn't died yet.

"2007-08-28 16:39:40","Rebel XT","1"," Another stunning winner from the bright minds at Canon","I spent three hours yesterday playing with the brand-new Canon Digital Rebel XT digital SLR camera, and man, was I impressed.

I hadn't been too impressed with the original Digital Rebel, except for its revolutionarily low price (for a d-SLR), because it was slow and felt slimsy. The new DR XT is quite different. Even though it's 3 ounces lighter than the original DR -- mostly due to the use of a smaller battery; see below -- its smaller form factor actually makes it feel more solid and ""real"". In other word, unlike the original DR, this one feels professional, not toy-like at all.

"2007-08-26 20:14:43","M285-E","1","Solid and reliable","At first, I wasn't terribly impressed. I had been accustomed to working
with a Toshiba Protege M405 at home and when I purchased the Gateway for
exclusive use at the office, my initial impression of the machine when
I put it into action was noticeably lacking in enthusiasm or excitement.

I've since come to appreciate this notebook for something much more
impressive that I couldn't gauge out of the box, and that was its
amazing reliability and performance over time.

This machine is solid. It does not crash.

The notebook hardware design is quite sleek and handsome. I am not so impressed with Vista running on this machine though. It just feels that Vista is a resource hog and is constantly running the CPU at 100% which causes the fan to run endlessly. I think the issue is that Sony used the same hardware specs as the previous TX series just to get a Vista version out quickly, but it really is not equipped to handle the new Vista OS as well. So I was disappointed when I upgraded to this notebook thinking that it would run faster, but actually it runs slower than my previous Vaio running Win XP. Though there are some improvements with Vista over XP, Vista probably runs better on a Duo Intel chipset than the Solo that is used in this notebook. The poor notebook is contantly working overtime just to do very simple normal every day applications and it takes forever to start up or reboot. If you just base it on looks alone, then it gets a 4 start rating.","Steven","1","1:3@2:3@3:3","20"
"2007-08-26 20:11:21","VGN-TXN27N/B","1","Vision of Vaio...","If you're buying this laptop, it's undoubtedly partially for the design, style and lightweight features of the TX series. You can get cheaper, better performing options at about the same weight, but it won't have the ""wow"" factor of this TXN27N. That being said let's get right into the pros and cons.

As a side note, if you're wondering about differences between the 25,27, 29 TX models, it's pretty straightforward. The 25 has 1GB RAM and 80GB hard drive, the 27 has 2GB RAM, 100 GB hard drive, the 29 is the same as the 27 except it comes with a carrying case and the exterior has a sleek special shiny coating. IMO, the 27N is the best value among the 3 when you look at the price points.

I was supposed to get a free matching mouse, when I received the mouse it looked two years old. When I got laptop working the wrist rest pad right next to the mouse pad was heating up to an uncomfortable level. When I notified PCmode, the supplier of the laptop, they agreed to replace it with another laptop. When I asked if it had the same problems, they told me it headed up as all laptops heat up. The agreed to replace the laptop with another laptop but with a 50% lesser value than the one I purchased.

I will never buy from these people again... ","Cappello","1","1:3@2:3@3:3","18"

The performance is phenomenal, the craftsmanship and style are only slightly short of amazing. (sturdy and stylish, but heavy and heats up quickly.) I hope I never have to deal with customer service but the product performs. The worse thing is that if you have it set to use full power all of the time you get maybe an hour and a half of battery time. Still like my PowerBook better though.","Next","1","1:3@2:3@3:3","17"

When Steve Jobs announced the new Macs, with Intel Core Duo processors I was almost certain I wanted to buy one. Why? Macs are well known for ease of use and capabilities, but they have managed all that for years, with processors that are not always top-notch. That all changed in January 2006.

This phone delivered with great reception, good sound quality, great battery life, and a very small size. Inside a building it works great. Why the low score? The tinted plastic over the display makes it impossible to see the display outdoors and in the car. If the sun is out, forget it! I even managed to figure out how to remove all of the wallpaper backgrounds and to maximize the contrast. Still, don't plan to use this outdoors. Nokia should recall this product to replace the tinted cover. Update: Yesterday this phone took was accidently dropped onto a very hard ceramic tile floor and it still works perfectly! A similar drop ended the life of my digital camera a few months ago. So, if I were to rate this cell phone now I would give it 3 stars, maybe even 4 stars. I like reliable, sturdy stuff and this cell seems to be unusually well made.","Sheridan","1","1:4@2:4@3:3","15"

2, you can not apply mp3 files as ringtones. However you can download mp3/aac ringtones from sprint (for a fee). Oh the original ringtones that came with the phone? They are just awful.

I think people that buy into those reviews are getting cheated out of an excellent phone. I've know several people with Razors that ALL like this much much better. The battery life is absolutely fine, and my phone is on vibrate all day. Maybe other reviewers are on the phone constantly on full blast playing mp3s and shooting video.. I don't get it. I've had this phone the better part of a year and never ran out of charge during the day. I plug it in at night. I work as an architect and am on the phone all day long and beat the living hell out of it.. which is another huge plus about this phone. It has a *sturdy* metal housing.. not thin toy crap a la razors or plastic like most phones. I don't do a lot of bluetooth, computer syncing, etc, just use the phone in a fairly conventional way, with regular camera use, and for that it is *easily* far and away the best phone I've ever owned.","solid phone","1","1:4@2:4@3:3","12"

============
- Form factor: It is beautiful, it is cute and catchy! It turns heads. Enough said.
- Size: Size is one of the strongest points considering all it does. It neatly slips into a shirt pocket or sits well on the belt.
- Keys: Could be a bit small but I could use it pretty easily though my fingers are bordering on 'butterfingers'.
- Trackball: Awesome! Just don't press it too hard while using it. Just 'roll-it'!. It is great while you have to move around the screen from control to control
- Voice-dialing: Has worked for me very well the 10 or so times I have tried in my van on the road and off. You have to first choose the voice dialing option from the list of icons on the main menu. I read you can ","Ashwini","1","1:4@2:4@3:3","11"
"2007-08-26 19:06:40","8525PDA","1","Worth the upgrade!!!","I've had this phone now for 2 weeks and it has met all of my expectations and exceeded them even. I upgraded from the 8125 and just about everything is a huge improvement!
The 3G(UMTS) is very impressive with it's speed. I even use this phone as a modem on my home pc and it's nearly identical in speed as DSL when surfing the net or downloading file/music etc.
Camera is very impressive with clear resolutions for a camera phone with the 2MP.
I also use a bluetooth headset 2.0 with this and mine works wonderfully with sony erriccson; it's quite intuitive and picks up the signal instantly. The 'blackberry' scroll wheel is a huge plus on this phone and I find myself using this feature more than any other buttons. ","Armstrong","1","1:3@2:3@3:3","10"

PHONE: So can't really complain about much of anything. Phone has really intuitive interface, very easy to navigate as the arrow keys all function as shortcuts (to calls, file folders, aim, etc..). The walkman button is very convenient as it leads right to the music player. ","John Johnson","1","1:3@2:3@3:3","7"
